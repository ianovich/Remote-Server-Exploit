# HACKING A REMOTE VIRTUAL MACHINE SERVER USING METASPLOIT FRAMEWORK(FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!!) AND HOW TO MITIGATE THE RISK(VULNERABILITY) 


**OBJECTIVE**
The primary objective of this project is to educate on how the vsFTPd 2.3.4 backdoor vulnerability can be exploited and to provide guidance on how to mitigate such vulnerabilities. It is intended for educational purposes and to highlight the importance of keeping software up-to-date and securing FTP services.</br>

**SKILLS LEARNT**
**Understanding Vulnerabilities**</br>
Comprehend the specifics of the vsFTPd 2.3.4 backdoor vulnerability and how it leads to unauthorized access.</br>

**Using Metasploit Framework**</br>
Navigate and utilize Metasploit for penetration testing, including selecting and configuring exploit modules.</br>

**Exploit Execution**</br>

Execute exploits against vulnerable systems and verify successful exploitation.</br>

**Network and System Commands**</br>

Use basic Linux commands to interact with compromised systems and understand the Linux file system structure.</br>

**Mitigation Techniques**</br>

Learn the importance of software updates, service disabling, and secure alternatives like SFTP and FTPS.</br>
**Ethical Hacking Principles**
Recognize the ethical implications of penetration testing and the importance of authorization.</br>

**Documentation and Reporting**</br>
  Document the exploitation process and create comprehensive README files for security projects.
  
**Critical Thinking and Problem Solving**</br>

Troubleshoot issues during exploitation and develop effective mitigation strategies through critical thinking.</br>

**TOOLS USED FOR ABOVE PROJECT**</br>
**Metasploit Framework**</br>
For developing, testing, and executing exploits against remote targets.</br>

**Parrot OS**</br>
A platform with numerous tools for penetration testing and security auditing.</br>

**vsFTPd 2.3.4**</br>
The vulnerable FTP daemon used as the target for exploitation.</br>

**Linux Command Line**</br>
Basic commands (id, uname -a, ls, pwd) for interacting with the compromised system.</br>

**Nmap/ NmapSI4 GUI**</br>
A GUI for Nmap, used to perform intense scans on target systems to identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.</br>

**Metasploitable 2 Virtual Machine** </br>
A deliberately vulnerable virtual machine used as the target server for penetration testing and exploitation.</br>

**Steps**
1 ![ping](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79cecda7-3bf0-4a93-a2ad-67ff9ab9b007)
At first i used the ping command to ensure that the target machine was reachable over the network.


2 ![hostscan1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daa00ebc-f2df-4c00-a17c-5265e740e5b5)</br>
Afterwards used Nmap GUI version NmapSI4 to scan the target machine, I identified the vsFTPd 2.3.4 service running on port 21. Researching this version revealed that it has a known backdoor vulnerability. This information guided me to use a specific Metasploit module to exploit the vulnerability and gain unauthorized access to the target system.(For Educational Penetration testing purposes only)</br>

3 ![web1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9379b185-c46d-4956-9a4b-11a832533bbd)
Discovered The vsFTPd 2.3.4 vulnerability through Rapid7 vulnerability database. This vulnerability is known as the "vsFTPd 2.3.4 Backdoor Command Execution" which involves a backdoor in vsFTPd versions 2.3.4 and earlier.The details  confirmed that it is a backdoor that opens a port that listens for incoming connections. This backdoor allows for remote command execution as the root user.

4 ![website](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfdc6ee3-0bf9-463e-8808-fde2f950f839)
This vulnerability can be exploited using the metasploitable framework.

5 ![exploit 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddd9e7f0-ec6e-48ce-b32e-c48897b81c4b)
Launched Metasploit Framework.</br>
Selected exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor module.</br>
Set the RHOST option to the target IP address (10.0.2.4), which is the IP of the vulnerable vsFTPd server.</br>
Ran exploit command.

6 ![exploit2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec2f0357-3c85-4bcd-8ce9-a6ac454493ef)
First attempt failed to create a session.</br>

Retried exploit, successfully triggered backdoor.</br>

Gained Access to the remote server successfully and obtained a command shell (uid=0(root) gid=0(root)).</br>

Verified root access with id.</br>

Checked system info with uname -a and explored file system with ls.</br>

**HOW TO MITIGATE THE ABOVE SECURITY RISK**</br>

Configure Firewall-Use a firewall to restrict access to the FTP service to only trusted IP addresses or networks.</br>

Close Unused Ports- Ensure that ports not used by services are closed.</br>

Disable Unnecessary Services-If FTP is not required, consider disabling the vsFTPd service entirely.</br>

Regular Updates and Patching - Regularly check for and apply security patches for all software to protect against known vulnerabilities.</br>

Security Monitoring- Implement logging and monitoring to detect unusual activities or potential exploits.</br>

Use Strong Authentication-Enhance Security Use strong passwords and consider additional authentication mechanisms.</br>
